In this assignment, we decided to implement the Ensemble Learning methods. 
We chose a network composed of 3 layers with an input features of 28x28, a 100 for the hidden layer and 10 for the output.
We decided to create 50 networks which composed our ensemble and used a dropout proportion of 0.1 for the train as well as for the test.
To obtain the weights of our networks, we uses the batch gradient descent with 20 epochs. To make our model more robust,
we created a perturbed data set thanks to the Fast Gradient Sign Attack algorithm with epsilon = 0.08.
The loss was then computed by the sum of the loss of the perturbed data passed through the log_softmax function and the loss of the original data passed through the same function.
Finally, for our prediction, the estimations were the sum of the estimations of the different networks of our ensemble divided by the number of networks present in our ensemble.
Each network estimation for the 10 digits was first pass through a softmax function to be sure that they sum up to one.
